# Leetcode journey 🚀

If anybody outside of me actually decide to visit this repo, don't take it too seriously 😁.
It's main purpose is to document my journey on [Leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/pavelpazdernik) from the very start
and just see how it goes.

Have a wonderful day 👋🏻

## Languages I am primarily using:
